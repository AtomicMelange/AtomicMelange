- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtomicMelange
- Still deciding what I want this to look like/be for me. It'll be bare for a while until I decide/create. 
- 👀 I’m interested in networking, music, information security, Dune, and my right to privacy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, networking (primarily Cisco), and anything technical that peaks my interest! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... TBD
